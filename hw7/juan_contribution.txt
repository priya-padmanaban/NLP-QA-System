HW6
Created pipeline for get_answer()
coded overlapping for get_answer()
coded chunking based on the chunking demo stub code.
made if else cases for chunking and basic baseline operation.

HW7
Improved chunking to be able to classify different types of Wh-questions.
Chunking was not able to classifiy who-type questions before.
Implemented constituency parse trees to be able to more accurately answer medium level questions.
A lot of the questions was answered by the baseline algorithm, the reason for this was that the if statements did not capture questions that can be answered by other algorithms.
For example, a medium question with type-Story could be answered by chunking, which was passed to baseline before.
Re-ordered questions to be handled by appropriate algorithms.
